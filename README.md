Advent Calendar for Cardiff School of Physics and Astronomy

### Viewing
The file advent-new.html should display the latest version. At present, the date is forced to be 5th December 2016.

To view all boxes, edit the line `var thisyear=2016;` to set a future year.

### Editing

Update dayinfo.json with new information.

##### Tips:

 * Escape all double-quote marks with a single back-slash (otherwise they get confused with the json format).
     * (i.e. write `\"my quote\"` instead of `"my quote"`).
     * Alternatively, use single quotes, which shouldn't get confused.
 * Make sure the json is valid, visit <http://jsonlint.com> if it's not working.
 * Add html tags if you link - whatever you write will appear in a `<div>` element in the "pop-up" box.
 * Try to make the images the correct aspect ratio. The thumbnail can be different from the main image if necessary.
