For example, most amino acids found in living organisms are left-handed, whereas most sugars produced by nature are right-handed.</p><p>Many scientists believe that chiral molecules were an important 'prebiotic' precursor to life. Chiral molecules older than the Earth itself have been spotted in meteors and comets, which suggests that life may have extraterrestrial origins. As a result, astrobiologists studying the possible emergence of life on other planets are keen to understand where prebiotic chiral molecules are formed in the universe."

  "text":"To the untrained eye this picture looks like a bit of crinkled wrapping paper, but in fact it shows a microscope image of a synthetic lipid bilayer (a double layer of lipid, or fatty, molecules). The image is around a third of a millimetre across, and shows the bilayer in the process of freezing from its fluid state into a more rigid and ordered solid state. The solid-ordered regions push out the fluorescent \"label\" which makes the four-nanometre-thick bilayer visible, and so they appear as dark hexagons or lines crisscrossing the surface. Lipid bilayers are important because they form the basis of the cell membrane, a thin barrier which separates the cell interior from its environment.</p><p>The physical properties of the lipid bilayer affect a wide range of cellular processes. One highly controversial area in which the physics of the lipid bilayer is particularly important is the lipid raft hypothesis which suggests that there are small domains with high molecular order called rafts \"floating\" in the surrounding sea of liquid phase lipids. The biophysical properties of these rafts have been implicated in signalling between neighbouring cells, the mechanism of HIV infection of cells, and cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy drugs.</p><p>Fluorescently labelled lipids are commonly used in investigations of bilayer phase behaviour to make the different phases bilayers visible with a microscope. In this experiment, the result of a long-standing collaboration between physics and biosciences at Cardiff, it was found that the very presence of a label alters the phase behaviour, thus making understanding the process all the more important."
