  "text":"The search for gravitational waves has been on for decades, ever since physicists realised that there might be a way to detect the elusive ripples in space-time that Einstein predicted 100 years ago.</p><p>In February 2016 it was announced that the LIGO experiment had succesfully detected gravitational waves from the merger of two massive black holes about a billion light years away. LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory, uses a powerful laser and a 'L'-shaped arrangement of mirrors to detect miniscule distortions in space.</p><p>The gravitational physics group in  has been involved in the search for decades, particularly in the areas of simulating the gravitational wave signal from merging black holes, and in the process of extracting the signal from the noise.</p><p>The signal was actually detected back in September 2015, meaning that last Christmas was rather busy for all our colleagues in LIGO..."

  "text":"This time of year, at least in the UK, is when the Sun is at its lowest, and the days are at their shortest. It follows that it's all the more important to have more efficient solar power cells.</p><p>Solar cells are currently made from silicon, but over recent years other materials have started to compete in terms of efficiency and cost. One such new type of materials are perovskite-structured crystals, which are the fastest-evolving technology around.</p><p>Cardiff physicists are part of an international group trying to understand perovskite-structured materials in order to make larger, more efficient solar cells. To do this they used the European Synchroton Radiation Facility in Genoble, France, to fire x-rays at samples and reveal their structure.</p><p>The results are helping guide the further development of low-cost materials for efficient large-area solar cells, and could be crucial for the future progress of the field of solar power generation."

Over in the United States, the people looking after the twin <a href='http://ligo.org'>LIGO</a> detectors in <a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/LA'>Livingston (Louisiana)</a> and <a href='https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/WA'>Hanford (Washington)</a> got a last-minute surprise present.</p><p>At about 10:40pm in Livingston, and 6:40 in Hanford, the alerts came up that LIGO have made another detection. Of course, here in the UK it was already Boxing Day, and since the scientific standard is \"<i>Universal Time</i>\" (which is the same as GMT), this became known as the \"<a href='https://losc.ligo.org/events/GW151226/'>Boxing Day event</a>\".</p><p>With most of the LIGO team busy with the first detection, which had arrived back in September 2015, the analysis took a little while. In June 2016, the LIGO team announced their <a href='http://chrisnorth.github.io/plotgw/'>catalogue</a> of sources. With two firm detections of gravitational waves, and a third less-firm candidate, the era of gravitational wave astronomy as truly begun."
