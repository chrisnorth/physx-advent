20,Introducing our bright new stars,,"For three years, <a href='http://www.universe.wales/about'>Universe in the Classroom</a> has been running a successful voluntary role model scheme with BSc, MSc and PhD students from the Cardiff University Schools of Physics and Astronomy, and Mathematics. These <a href='http://www.universe.wales/stars'>Stellar Role Models</a>, or STARS, visit primary schools across Wales to help inspire and educate students using Astronomy.A role model is a person who inspires and encourages us to strive for greatness, live to our fullest potential and see the best in ourselves. A role model is someone we admire and someone we aspire to be like. STARS do not only pass on new knowledge and skills, they also act as role models, demonstrating to children that anyone can be a scientist, regardless of age, gender or background.We are now very proud to have 51 enthusiastic students acting as STEM role models for young welsh children. By taking part in the project, STEMM students offer a diverse pool of representatives; including Welsh-speakers, female scientists and a range of ethnic groups and backgrounds, who will tackle diversity and gender issues in science and technology across Wales and broaden young children’s ideas of who can be a scientist at an age where impressions can become fixed.",http://www.universe.wales/,
